Adyen Clientside Encryption on iOS Demo New version

# Introduction

This app is intended as a demo to show how to submit credit-card data
to the Adyen backend in a secure way from an iOS app. It may be used 
as a starting-point to write your own iOS app that includes Adyen payment 
functionality.

# About the app

This is a new demo using a native iOS encryption, and not depending on OpenSSL.

The functionality of the app is simple. It consists of a single screen. This screen allows
the user to enter creditcard data (number, CVC, cardholder name, expiry date) and an amount and 
a currency.

After pressing `Submit`, the app will encrypt the credit-card data, and submit it, along with the 
amount and currency, to the Adyen backend. The result of the payment is shown at the bottom of the 
screen.

For configuration, the app supplies a settings bundle. This means that its settings can be edited
in the standard iOS settings app. The parameters that can be set are: Merchant account, username, password,
and public key. The values for these parameters are supplied by Adyen.


# Writing your own

When writing your own app, copy the Objective-C files from the `Encryption` and `ADYEncription` folders.
The files in the `App` folder exist only for demo-purposes, you don't have to copy them.

When your app wants to submit credit-card data to the Adyen backend, first create an instance
of the `PaymentRequest` class and populate its fields. The `card` property must be filled with
a `Card` object, whose properties should also all be filled.

Next, set the `delegate` property of the `PaymentRequest` instance to some object implementing
the `PaymentRequestDelegate` protocol. This delegate will be informed about the outcome
of the payment.

Finally, call `[PaymentRequest submitWithMerchantAccount:username:password:publicKey:]`. The
four parameters, `merchantAccount`, `username`, `password`, and `publicKey` are specific to
you as a merchant, and are supplied by Adyen.

After this, the `PaymentRequest` object encrypts the credit-card data and sends all data
to the Adyen backend. At the end, one of the methods on your delegate is called to inform you
of the outcome.
